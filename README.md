# WaveGame
This is a test game I made over the summer to learn more about Java and game development. It is not a perfect product. It is also not 100% original code, as I followed a YouTube tutorial, but I understand the code and have made my own changes to it.

Side note: I am not entirely sure if the code will run on other computers. I have tried to export all the proper files, but I could not make an executable jar file.
